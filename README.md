## Stockify - Paper Treading Stock Simulator

How often we think of starting out our trading journey but mostly withdraw our plans due to various reasons. Sometimes we are skeptical about risking our money, or we may lack experience in markets and other times we do not have the money to trade or invest.

Our application Stockify, allows the user to buy and sell stocks using virtual money in a gamified manner. The idea is to give users hands on experience while learning, analyzing and improving their performance using features provided by our platform.

After making a profile, the user shall receive 1 Lakh rupees which can be used to buy or sell stocks. They can also compete with users all over the globe through a common leaderboard sorted on the basis of overall profit gained. 

It provides a facility to practice trading while also learning at the same time, as it has a feature of 'Learning Page'. The Learning Page is equipped with step by step guidance materials for beginners. 

To assist the user in making decisions, we have a 'Recommendation Page' that tells the top gainers and top losers in stocks using live market data. Besides, to understand the market sentiment, users can express their views by writing blogs on stocks and discussing it further in the comments section.

In order to facilitate the user in making calculated decisions, Stockify has features like : a. showing live time series graphs for each stock;
 b. stock price prediction to find the current price of stock, if it had been bought x time period ago; and c. predicting whether a stock price will increase using ML algorithm. 

In future, we plan to build more games for the users customized according to experience, geography, portfolio of stocks, etc.
